# pose-data-pipeline
Build a robust Python data pipeline that ingests raw 2D keypoints, performs temporal slicing and normalization, and visualizes the "Model-Ready" data.

The dataset consists of 1.5 million frames of 2D pose detections from 5 subjects (S1, S5-S8) performing 15 actions (Walking, Eating, Sitting, etc.), captured from 4 camera viewpoints. The input features are 17-joint skeletons generated by a Stacked Hourglass network.
